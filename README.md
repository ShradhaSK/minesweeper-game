This game probably brings back childhood memories for most, if not all, of us. I remember spending hours together hooked to the screen of my Windows '95 desktop trying to figure out a way to win the game! In fact, Minesweeper has its origins in the earliest mainframe games of the 1960s and 1970s. The earliest ancestor of Minesweeper was Jerimac Ratliff's Cube. The basic gameplay style became a popular segment of the puzzle game genre during the 1980s.

# Getting Started

**Rules**
The rules are straightforward:
1. Click on any one of the cells/boxes in the grid to start
2. The numbers depict how many mines are adjacent to any given cell.
3. The purpose of the game is to navigate the board without clicking on any of the mines/bombs
4. Use "Cntrl + Click" to add a flag to a cell if you think it's a mine. ("Cntrl + Click" again to remove the flag if you change your mind)

**Winning/Losing**
- If you click on a mine: GAME OVER, pal. Clicking on Try Again will reset the game and you can try your luck once more!
- Uncover all the cells without mines and flag all the cells with mines to win!
